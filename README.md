# FlyBack
Apple's Time Machine is a great feature in their OS, and Linux has almost all of the required technology already built in to recreate it. This is a simple GUI to make it easy to use. An example of it in action: [Screenshot](website/screenshot.png).

I am not affiliated with Apple. Please don't sue me. Apple owns the trademark for "Time Machine".

## Credits & Contributions
This project was forked from [https://code.google.com/archive/p/flyback/](https://code.google.com/archive/p/flyback/) under the terms of its MIT License. It is not actively maintained by me, but you can feel free to submit a pull request and I will review it. If it gets enough attention, I might actively contribute as well.

## Limitations
Git cannot archive files that don't fit in main memory. Therefore, most large files are excluded from backups by default (in the preferences). Hopefully they will fix this bug soon.
